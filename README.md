A simple and responsive To-Do List web app built using **frontend** and **backend**.  
This project was developed and tested directly on a mobile device, so appearance and interactions are optimized for phones.

## Features

- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Simple and clean UI

1. **Add a Task:**  
   Enter your task in the input box and press the "Add" button.

2. **Complete a Task:**

3. **Delete a Task:**  
   Press the delete button next to any task to remove it.



## Notes
